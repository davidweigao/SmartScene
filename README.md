# SmartScene
This app has three functions:
1: Do you think it's inconvenient to change your phone to mute mode when in office, change it back to sound at home? 
This is an app to remember your location based on the wifi information the phone is connected and swith to configured volume and vibration setting.

2. Cannot find your phone and it's in mute mode? 
This is an app let you send message from another phone and it will make noise even it's in mute mode

3. Don't want to miss important message but your phone is in mute mode?
THis is an app let you set rules so that some messages will still notify you even in mute mode.
For example, make a rule : Whatsapp message from Alice will always make sound.

This project is still under development. Progress: realized basic functionality of feature 1 and 3. Need UI design support
